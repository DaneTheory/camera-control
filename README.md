Controlling a camera in a ThreeJS scene with your phone.

This prototype was made for a Real Time 3D presentation. It was done in an evening so don't be judgey :)

There are currently a few issues with the translation of the gyroscope information as well as the rotation of the 3D camera. I intend to fix that in the near future.
